## Bio

I studied computer science at UCLA and have worked at both small startups and large fortune 500 companies. Currently I'm living and working in China. 

My programming interests initally were with distributed systems and I my first job was working with p2p protocols. The more I worked the more my interests have grown to include design, security, hardware, data analytics/AI, and much more. I mainly code in C, Rust, Python (data analytics/ML), Js/typescript(web/react/react native), but also have experience with Erlang/Elixir, Java, Swift.
